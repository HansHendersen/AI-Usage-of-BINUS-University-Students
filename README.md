My team and I made a survey about AI Usage of Bina Nusantara University students' AI usage. The questions are as follows:
- What is your study program?
- What type of AI that you use the most to help your studies?
- How often do you use AI in a day?
- How much do you rely on AI in your studies?
- How important is AI to help you understand classes?
- How much do you use AI in your projects?
- Have you participated in competitions?
- If you have, what role does AI play in the competition?
- Range of your GPA.

I used R Markdown to encode every reply of the questions above.
I plotted the frequency of AI usage to see how many students in each category.
From that plot, we can see that there are a lot of students that replies with 'sometimes' and 'often', while 'very often' and 'rarely' are rarely chosen.
Lastly, I want to see the correlation of the replies from frequency of AI usage and the reliant of AI. The result is there is a medium validity between the two questions and we can conclude that the replies are valid.
